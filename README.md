## PHP Tools ##

A small collection of PHP classes that I use frequently.

### Maps Class
This is a PHP class for easily creating google maps with points, circles or grid cells.  It can handle many points with minimal effort, and can be set up to interface with a database.  
Some examples: 
* [UConn Arboretum](http://www.uconnarboretum.uconn.edu/map.php)
* [Dimensions of Biodiversity](http://dimensions-za.com/map.php)

### Database Class
A PHP class to make interfacing with MySQL databases easier.  Does much of the heavy lifting and also provides some security if prepared statements are used.
